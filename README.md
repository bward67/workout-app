This is the first proper App I have created. It combines by more recent love of coding and my long time passion with health and fitness.

My coding journey has been so fulfilling. It came at a time when I wasn't sure that I was ready for early retirement. I knew I needed something to satisfy my constant need to be productive and creative.

I know I still have a lot to learn and so I will continue taking courses especially through Scrimba. I will also move forward to create some new bigger and better Apps. However, I will keep improving and adding to this one as I use it myself everyday.

Happy coding!
